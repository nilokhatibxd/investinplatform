# Lebanon One Deck – Scenario 1 Data Pack  
## Opening a Private Dental Clinic – Lebanon Context (2025)

This file gives background data and factual context that can be used to answer a query like:  
“I want to open a dental clinic in Beirut. Show me what the government knows about this area and what I should consider before investing.”  

It is structured so a model can build a location-aware, data-rich report for a dental clinic concept in any Lebanese urban area, especially Beirut.

## 1. National Health and Dental Context

### 1.1 Health system and spending

- Lebanon has a mixed public–private health system in which a large share of outpatient care (including dental) is delivered in small private clinics.  
- Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) indicators show dentists per 10,000 population increasing from roughly 12–16 in the 2010s to about 20.4 per 10,000 by 2024, indicating a high dentist density nationally.  
- Health spending in Lebanon has historically been high as a share of GDP, with a large role for private and out-of-pocket payments.  

### 1.2 Oral disease burden

Recent oral-health research and WHO country profiles show:  

- Very high prevalence of dental caries among children (around 85–90 percent of 12–15 year olds affected in large samples).  
- Very high prevalence of periodontal disease (over 90 percent in some age groups).  
- Significant productivity losses and financial burden linked to untreated oral disease.  
- Newer national studies up to 2025 still report poor oral health status, with the situation likely worsened by the economic crisis.

### 1.3 Dentist workforce and quality gaps

- Lebanon is among Eastern Mediterranean countries with one of the highest dentist-to-population ratios (around 20 dentists per 10,000 people).  
- Studies on Lebanese dentists highlight gaps in medical-emergency preparedness, infection-control practices, and standardized protocols in private clinics.  

These points show a paradox: high numbers of dentists in urban centers but persistent unmet oral-health needs and quality gaps, especially outside core districts and in vulnerable groups.

## 2. Professional and Facility Licensing – Key Facts

### 2.1 Who can own and run a dental clinic

In practice, a Lebanese-licensed dentist is expected to be responsible for the clinic’s professional activities. Core elements:

- Professional pathway generally includes:  
  - A recognized dental degree and internship.  
  - Passing relevant national exams where applicable.  
  - Registration with the Order of Dentists in Lebanon (ODL).  
  - A license to practice dentistry issued or endorsed by the MoPH.  

- For foreign investors, available sources indicate that foreigners may establish businesses under similar conditions as Lebanese nationals, subject to Commercial Registry and sector rules.  

### 2.2 Legal entity and business registration (generic, not clinic-specific)

Typical sequence for starting a small business such as a clinic in Lebanon (Beirut example), based on Doing Business and legal guides:  

1. Choose legal form (commonly:  
   - Société à Responsabilité Limitée (SARL) – limited liability company.  
   - Sole proprietorship or partnership in smaller cases.)  
2. Deposit share capital in a bank and obtain a bank certificate (for SARL / SAL).  
3. Draft and notarize Articles of Association, including purpose (e.g. “dental medical clinic and related services”), shareholding and management.  
4. Register with the Commercial Registry in Beirut (or relevant city) and obtain a Commercial Registration number.  
5. Notify the Ministry of Finance of commencement of operations and obtain a Tax Identification Number.  
6. Register with the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) for employees.  

Indicative timelines from Doing Business data (pre‑crisis) show the business registration process taking around 10–15 days in the best case, but in practice this can stretch longer.

### 2.3 Facility / clinic establishment license (MoPH and municipality)

MoPH materials on operational licenses in the health sector, although written mainly for hospitals, indicate the logic of facility licensing that also applies to clinics. Key requirements generally include:

- Application form for establishing a health facility.  
- Real-estate documents (ownership deed or lease contract).  
- Comprehensive real-estate certificate for the premises.  
- Building blueprints, signed by sanitary engineering officials at MoPH and sealed by the Order of Engineers and Architects.  
- List of medical and technical equipment to be installed.  
- Occupancy permit or equivalent municipal approval for using the premises as a clinic.  
- Safety and fire-protection requirements aligned with building regulations.  

The MoPH is responsible for:  

- Issuing certificates of practice for health professions.  
- Issuing certificates for health facilities.  
- Conducting quality control on medical facilities.  

Municipalities (e.g., Beirut Municipality or others) control:  

- Zoning and land-use permissions (whether a medical clinic is allowed in the selected building/area).  
- Local signage, building safety, and occupancy rules.  

### 2.4 Devices and supplies

For certain categories of medical devices (e.g., imaging, implant kits), MoPH manages a medical device registration system that requires dossiers and conformity documents, although not every low-risk device must be registered. This matters when a clinic plans to install radiography, CBCT, or specialized implant systems.

## 3. Spatial and Market Data – Beirut Focus

This section focuses on quantitative or semi-quantitative information that a government-owned platform could surface when a user enters “Dental clinic” plus a specific Beirut area.

### 3.1 Dentist density and competition

From MoPH and WHO data:  

- National dentist density: about 20 dentists per 10,000 population (2022–2024 estimates).  
- Dentists are unevenly distributed:  
  - High concentration in Beirut and Mount Lebanon (urban core).  
  - Lower density in Bekaa, North, and South governorates.  

A government system combining MoPH and Order of Dentists registries could show, per Beirut neighborhood or district:

- registered_dentists_count  
- licensed_dental_clinics_count  
- dentists_per_10k_population  
- clinics_per_10k_population  

By comparing these to national averages, an area can be classified as having high, medium, or low competition in dental services.

### 3.2 Population and demand signals

Using census and survey-style data (conceptually available to government), location profiles can include:

- population_total and population_density per district or cadastral zone.  
- age_structure (percentage of children, working-age adults, and elderly).  
- income_band indicators (low / medium / high), based on tax records, property prices, or survey data.  
- insurance_coverage_rate (share of residents with any formal health insurance).  
- Indicators of oral-health need, such as:  
  - Prevalence of caries and periodontal disease in available surveys.  
  - Utilization rates of dental services, if recorded.  

Together, these can be used to derive a “dental service gap” for each area:

- High service gap: low clinic supply + high population + high oral-disease indicators.  
- Low service gap: many clinics + relatively high utilization and better access.

### 3.3 Built environment and accessibility

From real-estate and market studies, plus planning data, for each central Beirut area (for example Hamra, Achrafieh, Badaro, Clemenceau, Monot, Sodeco), data that could be surfaced include:

- Typical commercial rents for clinic-size spaces (e.g., 40–120 m²), such as:  
  - Lower bands around USD 500–800 per month in some mixed-use or peripheral zones.  
  - Mid bands around USD 800–1,500 per month in established neighborhoods.  
  - High bands above USD 1,500–2,500+ per month near prime streets, hospitals, or business clusters.  
- Traffic and footfall drivers, such as:  
  - Proximity to universities.  
  - Proximity to hospitals and medical centers.  
  - Presence of office clusters, retail streets, and hospitality venues.  
- Access and transport:  
  - Distance to main roads and public transport routes.  
  - Parking availability and typical congestion levels.

Tourism and hospitality data show that Beirut’s F&B and hospitality sectors have been recovering, with hundreds of cafés, bars and restaurants in 2024 and outlet growth above 10–15 percent over 2023, although recent conflict has again affected tourism flows. For a dental clinic, this context matters because:

- Areas with strong hospitality and retail clusters often have higher daytime population and footfall, which can support private healthcare demand.  
- Tourism and expatriate flows can influence demand for cosmetic or higher-end dental services.

### 3.4 Risk and stability indicators

From macro reports (UNDP, investment climate statements, etc.), potential location-level or city-level risk data the government could surface:

- Electricity reliability scores, proxying hours of grid electricity vs. generator use.  
- Business continuity indicators (for example, percentage of MSMEs that temporarily closed or permanently shut in specific districts after the 2024 conflict).  
- Security and disruption indices (for example, protests, road closures, or damage to infrastructure).  
- Tourism and visitor volumes, where relevant to demand.

These indicators help an investor understand operational risks beyond pure health-sector metrics.

## 4. Regulatory and Administrative Data Points for a Pre‑Investment Report

When a user enters “dental clinic” and selects a Beirut location, a government system could pull together the following data fields (no UI assumptions, only content):

### 4.1 Activity classification and basic constraints

- Official activity code and description for “dental clinic / dental medical practice” as per the relevant business-activity list.  
- allows_foreign_ownership for this activity (yes/no, or percentage caps if any).  
- professional_owner_required (for example, at least one licensed dentist must be a partner or responsible director).  
- minimum_physical_requirements, such as:  
  - Minimum clinic floor area.  
  - Required rooms (waiting room, operatories, sterilization area, toilets).  
  - Requirements for accessibility (stairs/elevator, entry width).  
- device_regulation_flags (for example, imaging equipment, implant devices subject to registration).  

### 4.2 Licensing steps and indicative SLAs

For a simple solo-dentist clinic, indicative steps and typical time ranges (where government has data):

- professional_license_verification_time_days – average days to verify dentist’s license and Order registration.  
- company_registration_time_days – average days to complete registration at Commercial Registry and obtain tax number (historically around 10–15 days under optimal conditions).  
- clinic_establishment_license_time_days – average days from complete file to MoPH decision for clinic establishments.  
- municipal_approval_time_days – average days for municipal zoning, signage, and occupancy approvals.  
- device_registration_time_days for any high-risk devices (if required).  

### 4.3 Cost-related data (indicative ranges, not tariffs)

Government-held or derived data could include:

- Official fees for:  
  - Professional license renewal.  
  - Facility license issuance and renewal.  
  - Company registration and annual fees.  
  - Municipal signage or business license fees.  
- Typical rent bands for clinic-suitable spaces in the selected area (based on aggregated rental contract data or property declarations).  
- Range of utility and generator costs per month for comparable clinics.  
- Payroll benchmarks for dental assistants, reception staff, and hygienists, based on social-security and labor-market data.

## 5. Quality, Safety and Public-Health Alignment

### 5.1 Emergency preparedness and infection control

Recent research on Lebanese dental clinics reports:  

- Inconsistent adherence to infection-control protocols (for example, sterilization, sharps handling).  
- Varying levels of preparedness for medical emergencies in clinics (availability of emergency drugs, equipment, and training).  

A public database could expose, for each clinic or area:

- inspection_count_last_3_years  
- inspection_non_compliance_flags (anonymized aggregate for the area).  
- emergency_preparedness_indicator (for example, share of clinics meeting a defined standard).  

### 5.2 Alignment with oral-health priorities

WHO and national data underline:  

- High burden of caries and periodontal disease in children and adults.  
- Concerns about worsening oral health due to economic crisis and reduced access.  

From a policy point of view, a pre‑investment report could connect a location’s dentist density, demographic structure (children, elderly), and economic vulnerability indicators to show whether a new clinic in that area improves access for priority groups or mainly increases competition in already well-served zones.

## 7. Notes and Limitations

- Sources for this file include MoPH indicators, WHO oral health profiles, World Bank “Doing Business” documentation, investment-climate reports, and peer‑reviewed dental-public-health studies.  
- Exact legal requirements and fees can change; a real government system would query live registries and official schedules rather than relying on static text.  
- All numeric examples in templates are illustrative only and must be replaced with actual data held by the state.
